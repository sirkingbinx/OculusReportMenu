| Primary            |LP                          |RP                          |
| Secondary        |LS                          |RS                          |
| Grip                   |LG                         |RG                          |
| Trigger               |LT                         |RT                          |
| Thumbstick In |LJ                            |RJ                          |
| None | NAN | NAN |

Here is the default configuration:
```
openButton1 = RJ # right thumbstick in
openButton2 = LS # left secondary in
```

If you want to bind opening the menu to one button:
```
openButton1 = LP
openButton2 = NAN
```

You can also adjust the sensitivity for when it detects triggers and grips.
```
Sensitivity = 0.5
```
